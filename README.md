# Context_Awareness_App

Smart technology has arrived where computer detects the environment and behaves accordingly. 
In this busy world many people forget to adapt their phone to certain situations. This requires changing their phone settings when it needs to be changed depending on their location or other parameters. For example one forgets to turn the silent mode on when the person enters his/her workplace. When you are at your workplace it is annoying and distracting if your phone rings and you’re there, and even more irritating to co-workers if it rings and rings when you’re away from your desk. So the main idea behind the development of this app is to let your smartphone change its behaviour according to different events that arise.

The following are some of the basic functionalities of the application:
* User can set certain profiles which will change certain phone settings as per their preferences. 
* Preferences can be based on location or time. 
* On detecting locations set by the user, the phone can switch to the profiles set earlier by the user without them needing to manually change when the situation arises. 
* The action involves changing settings like turning Bluetooth on or off, monitoring battery level, enabling Wi-Fi when certain event is triggered and even changing modes (silent, vibrate and sound).

## Project Outcome:

The project outcome will be enhancing computer use throughout the physical environment, but making them effectively invisible to the user. The project urges to explore the environment to create solutions that adapt themselves to various situations. It helps in automating user’s task. It is mainly focussed on spatial contextual awareness and temporal contextual awareness. This application demonstrates context-aware computing. Context-aware computing refers to a general class of mobile systems that can sense their physical environment, and adapt their behaviour accordingly. Spatial and temporal contextual awareness can describe present context – the environment of the user at the present time and location, or that of a future context – where the user wants to go and what may be of interest to them in the approaching spatial environment.
There are many apps that already exists, but this project intends to make an application that supports users’ tasks and goals efficiently and effectively, and making it engaging and more intuitive to use.
